# py-wbwdi

The goal of ‘wbwdi’ is to provide a modern, flexible interface for accessing the World Bank’s [World Development Indicators (WDI)
API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation) through Python. ‘wbwdi’ allows users to download, process, and analyze WDI
indicators for multiple geographies and specific time periods. The package is designed to work seamlessly with International Debt Statistics (IDS) provided through the ‘wbids’ package and the R package [‘wbwdi’](https://github.com/tidy-intelligence/py-wbwdi).

This library is a product of Christoph Scheuch and not sponsored by or affiliated with the World Bank in any way, except for the use of the World Bank WDI API.
